# Frontend Engineer Challenge
## Using React and any available libraries, create a simple application using the StockTwits API.
Hint: you will need to have a separate backend to handle CORS.  
● Allow the user to input a US stock symbol or several symbols (eg: AAPL, BABA, BAC,
etc…)   

● Pull tweets from StockTwits that mention this symbol (stock symbols usually have a $
before them, like: $AAPL, $BABA, etc…)  

● Display the latest matching tweets. How you display them is up to you.    

● When a new tweet comes in, it should automatically be added without having to refresh
the page.   

● The user should be able to later add/remove symbols as well. If a user deletes a symbol,
the matching tweets should also disappear. 

● The page has to be responsive. 

● The number of tweets for a given symbol needs to be represented.  

● Pay attention to details and make the user-interface and user-experience the best you
possibly can, considering time constraints. 

● Treat it like a real project, so things like code structure, readability, reusability… should
be taken into consideration.

Code for this assignment needs to be hosted on GitHub and a working version must be
accessible via web.
Important note: you will not be judged on your design skills but make sure the presentation
of your project is clean and well organized. Feel free to use any UI libraries, like Material-UI
or Bootstrap.
